Short Parts Notifier for LedgerSMB
By Chris Travers, Metatron Technology Consulting

To use this software, edit the config.pl so that you can connect to the 
database.  Then you can run listener.pl and it will periodically check to see
if new there are parts that have become short through transactions.

At the moment, the report is triggered when an AR or AP invoice occurs and a 
part affected by the transaction is lower than the ROP.  When this happens, a
Notify is sent from the database, and the application prepares the report on its
next cycle.  Note that although the creation of a new part will not cause it to
trigger the report, the new part will appear on the report on the next run.

Any feedback, improvements, etc. are welcome.
