Known issues in LedgerSMB 1.2, Beta 1:

Installation/upgrade is not automated yet.

A few known issues with the documentation:
CLI API docs don't mention cookie handling
Need better documentation on role of UTF-8

Also intermediate rounding causes issues with discounts because the rounding is applied to 2 decimal places to the unit rather than the extended price.
