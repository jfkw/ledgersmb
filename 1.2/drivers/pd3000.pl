# Driver for Logic Controls PD-3000 Pole Display.
# As with all pole display drivers, the control codes are contained in a hash
# array called $pd_control.

# THis pole display uses separate meanings for LF and CR.  Both are included.
# LF moves the cursor to the other line (same position), while CR moves the 
# cursor to the left-most spot (same line).  Assume most PD's do this.
# Most of this is simple ASCII, but what to make things clear.

# This first part is straight from the manual.
# Not including the bit about installing fonts.

%pd_control = (
  'mode_vscroll' => pack('C', 18),
  'mode_normal' => pack('C', 17),
  'bright_full' => pack('CC', 4, 0xFF),
  'bright_high' => pack('CC', 4, 0x60),
  'bright_med' => pack('CC', 4, 0x40),
  'bright_low' => pack('CC', 4, 0x20),
  'backspace' => pack('C', 8),
  'htab' => pack('C', 9), # Functions like cursor movement
  'lf' => pack('C', 0x0A),
  'cr' => pack('C', 0x0D),
  'digit_select' => pack('C', 0x10), # Pack followed by a number 0-39
  'cursor_on' => pack('C', 0x13),
  'cursor_off' => pack('C', 0x14),
  'reset' => pack('C', 0x1F),
  'scroll_message' => pack ('C', 0x05), # Followed by up to 45 chars.
);

# A few more useful control sequences:
$pd_control{'new_line'} = $pd_control{'cr'}.$pd_control{'lf'};
