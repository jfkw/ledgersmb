README for SQL-Ledger Users
===============================

LedgerSMB is largely a drop-in replacement for SQL-Ledger.  The initial release
includes a number of security and data integrity improvements, and future
versions will likely add new features as well.

To convert an existing SQL-Ledger installation to LedgerSMB, copy the files from
the tarball over your existing SQL-Ledger directory and run the SL2LS.pl script.
This script will rename some files, delete others, and pretty soon you will have
a working LedgerSMB installation.

The database will be updated on first login.

You will also want to migrate your configuration by running the SL2LS.pl script included in this directory.
