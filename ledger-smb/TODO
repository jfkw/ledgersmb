* indicates items which will make the next release
% are tasks that are good for helping get up to speed in the code.

Higher priorities
- Fix the db upgrade routine so that it can be safely used between software 
  versions
- Create a new naming system that allows us to track db schema changes between
    different versions of SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB and 
- make utf-8 default
- Prevent printing without posting. 
- Add last cost field to laber/overhead creation screen.
- %code cleanup (move to established coding standards, not structural yet) 
	In Progress
- %xhtml compliant code
- central default database (maybe authentication abstraction here?)
- Fix reconcilliation summary report.
- Remove Dieter's sessionid timestamp since it serves no purpose.
- authentication abstraction for Kerberos, LDAP authentication, and the like.
- Authentication module for PostgreSQL databases.
- %Account transactions available from Balance Sheets and Income Statements via 
links.
- Replace the defaults table with one that is more normalized.
- Fix printing for Windows. 
  This turns out to be incredibly trivial.

Medium-longer term
- Database schema cleanup/rewrite
- Move all config information onto the Form object.
- Port SL-POS functionality into the fork.
- published API
- Command-line wrapper that is easy to use....
- SOAP or HTTP based interfaces (OpenLedger?)
- Credit Card Processing
- %Tighten up integrity controls in schema by replacing the insert/update with
  a single insert and adding foreign keys.
- Portable Data Terminal integration.
- %Merge web directories so that maintaining frames and no-frames browsers 
  is not a problem.
	No-frame browsers are important in some areas where screen resolution
	is limited and text-based keyboard entry is used.  I don't think
	support should be dropped for these browsers-- Chris Travers.
- Move to a template-based display system with main application logic being in
  a separate Perl module.
- Convert to use persistant database connections.
- Basic payroll module
- Multiple Shipto's associated with customers/vendors.
- Enforce transaction safety and protect against lost updates when editing 
  transactions
- %Add a javascript calendar to all date fields.  Must not cause problems when
  Javascript is not available.
