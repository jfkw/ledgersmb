# Data import script to migrate from version 1.1's flat file based
# users to version 1.2's central database.
#
# NOTE: This script will die if the user it tries to import is
# tied to a bogus or non-existing dataset/database. The fix
# is to edit the members file and either manually set the right
# database configuration for that user, or delete the user entirely.
#
# If the script makes it through all users it will print:
#
# 'SUCCESS! It seems that every user in the members file was imported!'
#
# If you don't get that output at the end of the script, something
# went wrong in the import.
#
# For help/troubleshooting please join the LedgerSMB users mailing
# list. Info on how to subscribe can be found here:
