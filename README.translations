Between LedgerSMB 1.1.1 and LedgerSMB 1.2, translations were changed to using a
standard naming scheme and formatting.  Upon upgrade, you may find that
LedgerSMB displays in a language different to which you previously configured, 
i.e. Swedish instead of Spanish, or more likely, English.  The table below
contains the mapping of old name to new name that is used in the user config
files.
