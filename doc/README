                LedgerSMB Small Medium Business Accounting
                     Version 1.2.0


DESCRIPTION:
------------
LedgerSMB is a double-entry accounting system written
in perl. It has been tested with PostgreSQL, Apache,
Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon, Explorer, Links, Lynx,
Konqueror, Voyager, W3M and Opera clients on Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, Windows, Mac computers and PDA's.

Data is stored in a PostgreSQLSQL database server, either 
locally or remote, the display is through a text or GUI web 
browser. The system is linked by a chart of accounts.  All 
transactions for AR, AP and GL are stored in a transaction 
table. Hyper-links from the chart of accounts let you view 
transactions posted through AR, AP and GL.

Configuration files let you specify to which SQL database server
to connect to, personal preferences such as company name,
language, number and date format, etc.

With the admin script you can create, edit or delete users,
create and delete datasets and set up the Chart of Accounts
and templates needed for the system.

You can have a group of users using the same dataset and
templates for generating Invoices, Income Statements and
Balance Sheets or a different set altogether.

Templates are supplied in html, text and tex format to
generate most of the forms. Forms can be printed to screen,
sent to a printer or e-mailed.
