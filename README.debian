Installation Notes Appendix for Debian

In the dists/deb directory, there files which provide information on which 
prerequisites can be installed via apt-get and which ones need to be installed 
via CPAN.

A simple way to do this is to:

apt-get install `cat required.deb.txt`
cpan 
> install Class::Std
> install Config::Std
